      <h1>WEEK 1</h1>
      <p>Ghost In the Shell</p><br><br>

  <p1>The city in Ghost in the Shell presented a dark and gloomy setting of the city. It looks busy even though its at night which 
      brings the idea of "the city never sleeps". It also seems mysterious.</p1><br><br>
      
      
  
      <p2>Barcelona City</p2><br><br>

  <p3>The city plan of Barcelona is very neat there are blocks of spaces that are for the buildings and pathways for cars and
      pedestrian traffic. Its really interesting especially from a bird's eye view that you could clearly see the grid plan of
      the city. The city also has some historic buildings that are placed next or accross to a new high rise building- the 
    clashing of old and new buildings. The city also has high rise buildings and sky scrapers.</p3><br><br>
      
      <p4>Rio De Jenario</p4><br><br>

      <image src="f2.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      
      <image src="f3.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>

 <p4>Rio De Janerio hosted the 2016 Olympics in which they spent alot of money on revamping the city and accomodating the 
      olympic games. There is a clear division in Rio; the favellas and the city. The Favellas may not be known as a city
      but it look like one- the city of the neglected. The amount of people living there are growing and there is no one to 
      help them.</p4><br><br>
      
      <p>Chernobyl</p><br><br>
      
      <image src="chernobyl.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      <image src="c1.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      <image src="c2.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      <image src="c3.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      <image src="c4.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      <image src="c5.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      
      <p4>After the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, the city became deserted, plants grew wildly and animals roamed freely
      while the late 1980s stood still. The city is still not livable and won't be for another few thousand years, but its
      fascinating to see a city "frozen" in time.</p4><br><br>
      
      <p>The Jetsons/><br><br>

      <image src="j5.jpg" alt="image missing" height="500" width="500" /><br><br>
      
      <p4>The Jetsons was created in the 60s, and it is a futuristic show, it portrays building elevated and people using
        flying saucers as cars, using robots to aid humans in everyday tasks.</p4><br><br>
